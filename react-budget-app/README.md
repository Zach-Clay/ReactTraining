# React Budget App

In this tutorial, I am following along with the Web Dev Simplified YouTube video you can find here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz8x71BiGXg. I created a budgeting app. This app is not using a backend, but information is stored in the browser using the useLocalStorage functionality in React.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running the app

In the project directory, you can run

- `npm i` to install dependencies, then
- `npm start` to start the application
